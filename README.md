This project combines data from two text files, removes common elements (duplicates), and organizes them into a single file. Users can easily upload files and click the "Extract Files" button to complete the process.
Features

    File Upload: Users can drag and drop files or click to upload them.
    Remove Common Elements: Duplicate entries between the two files are automatically removed, and only unique elements are merged.
    Progress Bar: A progress bar shows the status of the merging process.
    User-Friendly Interface: A simple, intuitive interface for quickly merging files.
    Output File: The merged content is available for download as a single text file.

Usage

    Clone or download the project:

    git clone https://github.com/tohan-tr/Extract-Files/tree/main

    Open the index.html file in a browser.

    Upload your files by clicking or dragging them into both "dropzone" areas.

    Click the "Extract Files" button.

    After the process is complete, download the TOHAN.txt file to your computer.
